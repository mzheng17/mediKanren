takes: a drug curie as a string (a-drug), a list of predicates of interest (predicates)
Does query X->O where X is a-drug and the edges are filtered by predicates
returns: a list of the curies O from the X->O query

#|
takes: a disease curie as a string (disease-curie), a set of patient symptoms/phenotypes (empty set if none) (patient-phenos)
Ranks the drugs related to the disease-curie by the nature and number of side effects they cause
returns: A list of 3 lists. These lists contain all of the drug curies resulting from a drug->disease-curie query sorted as follows:
         The last list contains the drugs that aggravate any pre-existing patient symptom.
         The middle list contains the drugs that would further aggravate any symptoms caused by the disease (disease-curie)
         The first list contains the rest of the drugs not in the 2nd or 3rd list that have a drug->disease (disease-curie) relationship.
         The drugs within all three lists are sorted (least to most) by the number of side effects they have.
